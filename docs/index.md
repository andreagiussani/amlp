# AMLP Digest Book: Data > Model

Welcome 👋  
This is a “book-style” set of short lectures. The focus is practical: **dataset + preprocessing + evaluation** first, models second.


## What you’ll find here

### Learning paths
**If you’re new / want a clean baseline**
- Pipelines & leakage → scaling → missing data → classical models → text baseline

**If you care about NLP**
- Text preprocessing → TF-IDF baseline → Transformers fundamentals → BERT/T5 classification

**If you care about performance**
- Better features → better splits → calibration → nonlinear models → transformer fine-tuning
